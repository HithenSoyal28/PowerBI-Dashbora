# Resilience and Robustness Analysis of TfL (Transport for London) Networks

## Project Overview
This project was part of my MSc in Data Analytics dissertation. It involved analyzing the resilience and robustness of Transport for London (TfL) networks using Python. 
By simulating disruptions and analyzing the network's response, I aimed to identify vulnerabilities and suggest improvements to enhance network stability.
